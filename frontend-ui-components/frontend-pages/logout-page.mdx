# Overview

The **Logout Page** component is responsible for securely ending a user session within the frontend application. When accessed, it triggers the logout process by invoking a GraphQL mutation to clear authentication tokens or cookies on the backend, updates the global authentication state, and provides feedback during the logout operation.

This page serves as a straightforward user interface screen that informs users of the logout status while handling the necessary authentication cleanup.

## Purpose

The Logout Page:

- Sends a GraphQL logout mutation request to the backend.
- On successful logout, clears the user authentication state in Redux.
- Shows a loading indicator during logout.
- Provides basic UI feedback (e.g., "Logging out..." message).
- Ensures that the user session is safely closed.

---

## How It Works

1. **Mutation Initialization:** The page uses Apollo Client's `useMutation` hook with the `Logout` mutation from the GraphQL API.

2. **Logout Invocation:** Immediately upon mounting, the page triggers the logout mutation.

3. **Redux State Update:** Upon mutation completion, it dispatches a `logout` action to clear authentication-related state from Redux.

4. **User Feedback:** Displays a message indicating that the user is currently logging out to signal progress.

5. **Error handling:** If any logout errors occur, appropriate notifications are dispatched (if implemented).

## Code Example

```tsx
import React, { FC, useEffect } from "react";
import { useMutation } from "@apollo/client";
import { useDispatch } from "react-redux";
import { LogoutDocument } from "../../generated/graphql";
import { AuthActions } from "../../store/auth";
import { notify } from "../../store/function";
import { Loading } from "../../components/loading";

const LogoutPage: FC = () => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  // Prepare the logout mutation hook
  const [logout] = useMutation(LogoutDocument);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Trigger logout mutation on mount
    logout({
      onCompleted: () => {
        dispatch(AuthActions.logout());
        notify("Logged out successfully", "success");
      },
      onError: () => {
        notify("Failed to log out", "error");
      },
    });
  }, [logout, dispatch]);

  return <Loading loadingText="Logging out..." />;
};

export default LogoutPage;
```

## Integration Details

- **GraphQL Backend:** Utilizes `Logout` mutation defined in the backend GraphQL schema to terminate user session.
- **Apollo Client:** The page uses Apollo's `useMutation` for sending mutation requests.
- **Redux Store:** Dispatches logout-related actions (`AuthActions.logout`) to clear frontend authentication state.
- **Notification System:** Uses a centralized notification method to inform users about logout success or failure.
- **Loading Indication:** Displays a loading spinner and message using a shared `Loading` UI component.
- **Routing:** Typically linked via a route that users navigate to when choosing to sign out.

This component represents a bridge between the frontend UI and backend auth state management, providing a safe and clean logout procedure.

This component is part of the authentication workflow of the application, ensuring that users can safely and clearly log out of their active sessions and have the frontend state updated accordingly.
