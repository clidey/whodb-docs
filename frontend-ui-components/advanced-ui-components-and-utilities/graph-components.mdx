# Graph Components

The **Graph Components** provide an interactive and dynamic way to visualize, layout, and interact with complex graph structures representing database schemas and their relationships. These components leverage the [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/) library to render nodes and edges with advanced customization, automatic layout algorithms, and user-driven actions.

This documentation covers the core graph components, their design, usage, and integration details within the WhoDB frontend architecture.

## Introduction

Graphs in WhoDB represent database storage units (e.g., tables, collections) and their relationships (e.g., foreign keys, joins). The Graph Components enable users to explore these structures visually, making it easier to understand schema connections and navigate complex database layouts.

## Key Components

### Graph

The primary interactive graph component encapsulating the entire graph visualization logic using React Flow.

- Handles node and edge state management.
- Supports layout via Dagre for automatic arrangement.
- Provides UI controls for re-layout and exporting the graph as an image.
- Accepts customizable node types such as the `StorageUnitGraphCard`.

Source: [`frontend/src/components/graph/graph.tsx`](https://github.com/clidey/whodb/blob/main/frontend/src/components/graph/graph.tsx)

### StorageUnitGraphCard

Visual representation of a database storage unit node within the graph.

- Displays key information about a storage unit.
- Supports interaction handlers for navigation and expand/collapse.
- Integrates with the Graph component as a node type.

### GraphEdgeConnectionLine

Custom connection line component for drawing edges while creating new connections interactively.

### FloatingGraphEdge

A floating edge component rendered statically to show connections between nodes.

Source: [`frontend/src/components/graph/edge.tsx`](https://github.com/clidey/whodb/blob/main/frontend/src/components/graph/edge.tsx)

## Graph Layout

The layout of graph nodes and edges is computed using the Dagre library.

- Supports direction options: `TB` (top-bottom) or `LR` (left-right).
- Calculates optimal node positions and edge paths.
- Updates React Flow state to reflect new layout.

Graph layout utility can be found here:

## Utilities

### Graph Creation Helpers

Utility functions to create nodes and edges with consistent format and styles.

```ts
import { Node, Edge, Position, EdgeMarker } from 'reactflow';

// Create a Node with specified id, type, and data
function createNode(
  node: Pick<Node, 'id' | 'type' | 'data'> & Partial<Node>,
  position?: { x: number; y: number }
): Node {
  return {
    id: node.id,
    type: node.type,
    data: node.data,
    position: position ?? { x: 0, y: 0 },
  };
}

// Create an Edge connecting source to target with custom attributes
function createEdge(
  source: string,
  target: string,
  type = 'default'
): Edge {
  return {
    id: `${source}-${target}`,
    type,
    source,
    target,
    markerEnd: {
      type: 'arrowclosed',
    } as EdgeMarker,
    className: 'stroke-gray-600 dark:stroke-gray-300',
  };
}
```

## Usage Example

Basic setup rendering a Graph with storage unit nodes and automatic layout:

```tsx
import React, { useState, useCallback, useMemo } from 'react';
import Graph, { StorageUnitGraphCard } from './graph';

const nodeTypes = { storageUnit: StorageUnitGraphCard };

function DatabaseGraph({ units, relations }) {
  const [nodes, setNodes] = useState(() =>
    units.map(unit => ({ id: unit.name, type: 'storageUnit', data: { unit }, position: { x: 0, y: 0 } }))
  );

  const [edges, setEdges] = useState(() =>
    relations.map(rel => ({ id: `${rel.from}-${rel.to}`, source: rel.from, target: rel.to }))
  );

  const handleLayout = useCallback(() => {
    // Trigger layout update
  }, []);

  return (
    <Graph
      nodes={nodes}
      edges={edges}
      setNodes={setNodes}
      setEdges={setEdges}
      nodeTypes={nodeTypes}
      onLayout={handleLayout}
    />
  );
}
```

## Architecture & Integration

- **React Flow**: Core dependency for graph rendering and interaction, providing virtualized canvas, drag/drop, and selection.
- **Graph Component**: Manages state for nodes and edges, interacts with layout utilities, and streams updates to React Flow on user or programmatic actions.
- **Node Types**: StorageUnitGraphCard and others define node appearance and behavior.
- **Layout**: Dagre library is employed to compute visually coherent node arrangement and edge routing.
- **Edge Components**: Custom components for interactive connection and static edge display.

Graph components are fully integrated into the WhoDB frontend, receiving data from GraphQL APIs (see [GraphQL Schema and Resolvers](/Architecture%20Overview/GraphQL%20Schema%20and%20Resolvers)) representing schemas and relationships. They enhance user experience by providing a clear and navigable visualization of database elements.
