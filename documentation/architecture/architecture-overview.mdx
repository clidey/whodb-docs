## Introduction

The Architecture Overview provides a high-level understanding of the WhoDB system, describing how its various components fit together to provide a seamless experience for managing and querying multiple database types via a unified API and frontend.

This overview covers the system's backend and frontend architecture, key subsystems such as the plugin engine, GraphQL API, authentication, and the user interface components.

---

## System Architecture Overview

WhoDB is designed as a modular, multi-database management platform that integrates various database types using pluggable backends and exposes these via a unified GraphQL API.

### Key Characteristics

- **Modularity:** Different database providers are supported using plugins.
- **Unified API:** A single GraphQL endpoint allows clients to interact seamlessly with multiple database types.
- **Extensible Frontend:** React-based UI leveraging Apollo Client and Redux for state management.
- **Authentication & Profiles:** Support for login profiles and secure authentication via HTTP middleware.
- **Rich Data Interaction:** Includes support for SQL execution, CRUD operations, filtering, and even AI chat integration.

---

## Backend Architecture

The backend is written in Go and designed around the following main components:

### 1. Server Initialization
- The entry point is the `main()` function in [core/server.go](/core/server.go).
- It initializes application settings, database engine, and HTTP router.
- Serves the REST and GraphQL APIs alongside embedded frontend static assets.
- Implements graceful shutdown handling to safely terminate server connection.

### 2. Plugin Engine ([core/src/src.go](/core/src/src.go))
- Initializes supported database plugins: Postgres, MySQL, SQLite3, MongoDB, Redis, ElasticSearch, Clickhouse.
- Provides selection and abstraction over the currently active plugin to handle database-specific queries and operations.

### 3. GraphQL API
- Built with [gqlgen](https://gqlgen.com/), the schema definitions and resolvers are found in [core/graph/schema.graphqls](/core/graph/schema.graphqls) and [core/graph/schema.resolvers.go](/core/graph/schema.resolvers.go).
- Exposes queries, mutations and AI chat interactions.
- Supports WebSocket for subscriptions.
- Serves endpoints via [core/src/router/router.go](/core/src/router/router.go) with HTTP middleware for auth, CORS, and logging.

### 4. Authentication & Authorization
- Uses HTTP middleware defined in [core/src/auth/auth.go](/core/src/auth/auth.go).
- Supports token validation and public routes for certain introspection.
- Cookie-based credential storage and session management is handled in [core/src/auth/login.go](/core/src/auth/login.go) and [core/src/auth/logout.go](/core/src/auth/logout.go).

### 5. Database Plugins
- Each database has a plugin implementing interfaces in [core/src/engine/plugin.go](/core/src/engine/plugin.go).
- Plugins handle native database operations with GORM or native drivers.
- Plugins manage schema introspection, raw SQL execution, data retrieval, and graph relationships.
- See individual plugins like [core/src/plugins/postgres/postgres.go](/core/src/plugins/postgres/postgres.go) for PostgreSQL, [core/src/plugins/mysql/mysql.go](/core/src/plugins/mysql/mysql.go) for MySQL, and others.

---

## Frontend Architecture

Built with React and TypeScript, the frontend serves a SPA which communicates with the backend via GraphQL.

### 1. Application Root
- Entry point is [frontend/src/index.tsx](/frontend/src/index.tsx).
- Configures React root and integrates providers for Apollo Client, Redux store, React Router, and PostHog analytics.

### 2. State Management
- Uses Redux with slices for Auth, Common, Database, Global, Settings, and Chat states.
- Persisted states using redux-persist.
- Store definition is in [frontend/src/store/index.ts](/frontend/src/store/index.ts).

### 3. Routing
- Defined in [frontend/src/config/routes.tsx](/frontend/src/config/routes.tsx).
- Differentiates between public and internal (private) routes.
- PrivateRoute component enforces authentication.

### 4. Components & Pages
- Components for UI controls like Inputs, Dropdowns, Buttons, Notifications.
- Pages include Login, Logout, Chat, Graph visualization, Storage Unit management, Raw SQL execution, Settings, Contact Us.
- Central app container and theming is in [frontend/src/app.tsx](/frontend/src/app.tsx).

### 5. GraphQL Client
- Configured Apollo Client in [frontend/src/config/graphql-client.ts](/frontend/src/config/graphql-client.ts).
- Provides typed hooks auto-generated from the GraphQL schema stored in [frontend/src/generated/graphql.tsx](/frontend/src/generated/graphql.tsx).

---

## GraphQL Schema & Resolvers

- The GraphQL schema is defined in [core/graph/schema.graphqls](/core/graph/schema.graphqls).
- Resolvers implemented in [core/graph/schema.resolvers.go](/core/graph/schema.resolvers.go) bridge the GraphQL API to backend logic.
- Support login/logout, settings updates, query of profiles, databases, schemas, storage units, rows, raw queries, graph data, AI providers and chat models.

Operations are exposed via the router and HTTP resolver layer at [core/graph/http.resolvers.go](/core/graph/http.resolvers.go).

## Integration Details

### Backend Components
- **Server (`core/server.go`)**: Starts HTTP server, initializes settings, engine, router, and handles shutdown.
- **Engine (`core/src/src.go` and `core/src/engine/engine.go`)**: Central orchestrator managing registered database plugins.
- **Database Plugins**: Implementations encapsulate database-specific logic, ensuring clean separation and extensibility.
- **GraphQL Layer (`core/graph` & `core/src/router`)**: Provides schema and resolver logic; integrates authentication.
- **Authentication (`core/src/auth`)**: Middleware and logic ensuring secure access.

### Frontend Components
- **React Frontend (`frontend/src/...`)**: Uses Apollo Client to communicate with backend GraphQL API.
- **Redux Store (`frontend/src/store`)**: Centralizes global application state.
- **Routing (`frontend/src/config/routes.tsx`)**: Defines public and private routes.
- **UI Components**: Enable rich interaction patterns for login, chat, queries, visualization.

### System Touchpoints
- The frontend consumes the GraphQL API over HTTP at `/api/query`.
- The backend embedded web server serves both the frontend static assets and API endpoints.
- Plugin engine abstracts underlying databases, exposing them uniformly to the GraphQL resolvers.
- LLM clients provide AI-powered capabilities integrating with the backend plugin interface.

This modular and layered approach promotes flexibility, ease of plugin development, and a consistent user experience across diverse database backends.
